# Batch Claims

Agent-managed batch state for both Claude Code and Cursor. **Do not put claim fields inside `BUILD_QUEUE.md`** — that file is user-owned and gets pasted over when the user adds or revises batches, which would wipe any state stored in it.

This file is the single source of truth for *who is working on what* and *what has been completed*. `BUILD_QUEUE.md` defines *what to build*; `CLAIMS.md` records *what has happened*.

See `AGENTS.md` for the full claim / finish / handoff / reclaim protocols.

## In progress

### Batch 12 — Google OAuth end-to-end
- Owner: claude
- Started: 2026-05-15 (today)

## Known issues (deferred fixes)

- **service_role grants for server-only tables** — root cause confirmed during Batch 11: this Supabase project has Data API "auto-expose new tables" OFF, so `service_role` does **not** auto-bypass grants. `app_config` was fixed in `002_app_config.sql` with an explicit `grant all to service_role`. The same gap still affects `analysis_locks`, `access_attempts`, `contracts`, `ib_api_metrics` from `001_initial.sql`. Visible today as `[signalRunner] cleanup error: permission denied for table analysis_locks` every 30s. Must be resolved before Batch 14 (signal pipeline writes to all of these). Likely fix: a `003_service_role_grants.sql` that adds `grant all on <table> to service_role` for each.

## Completed

### Batch 11 — Self-healing Cloudflare Quick Tunnel + FE URL bootstrap
- Owner: claude
- Started: 2026-05-15 (today)
- Finished: 2026-05-15 (today)
- Commit: b4b88fa
- Notes: cloudflared compose service + 002_app_config.sql + tunnelWatcher.ts + FE apiUrl bootstrap. Self-healing test verified end-to-end (docker compose restart cloudflared → new URL in Supabase within ~15s). Three follow-on fixes shipped under the same batch tag: cloudflared user: root for logfile perms, service_role grant for app_config, optimistic-claim dedup in the watcher.
